        explanation: "Gravity is that clingy ex who won't let you go. It's the reason you can't float away when adulting gets too hard. Newton got hit by an apple (rude) and figured out that everything with mass attracts everything else. Einstein later said 'nah, it's spacetime bending' like a TikTok dance challenge.",
        deepDive: "Gravity's strength depends on mass and distance. That's why you weigh less on Mars - not because you're healthier, but because Mars is lighter than Earth! Time also slows down near massive objects (yes, really). Without gravity, we'd all be floating in space like forgotten Amazon packages. Fun fact: Astronauts grow taller in space because gravity isn't compressing their spine!",

        explanation: "AI is like that one friend who's weirdly good at everything. It can write essays, create art, and even flirt (badly). Machine Learning means it learns from data - like how you learn from your dating app mistakes. Neural networks? Just fancy math pretending to be a brain. Don't worry, Skynet isn't happening... probably.",
        deepDive: "There's Narrow AI (good at one thing, like recommending Netflix shows) and General AI (doesn't exist yet, would be like a human). Most AI today is just pattern recognition on steroids. The 'intelligence' part is debatable - it's more like a super advanced autocomplete. Training AI models takes insane amounts of energy - some use as much electricity as small countries. So next time ChatGPT gives you bad advice, blame its carbon footprint!",

        explanation: "Time is that friend who's always late but also somehow runs out too fast. Physics says it's relative - meaning it literally moves slower when you're speeding (Einstein was wildin'). Your brain perceives time differently based on dopamine levels, which is why fun times fly and boring lectures feel eternal. Pro tip: Time doesn't heal all wounds, but it does make them easier to ignore.",
        deepDive: "According to quantum physics, time might not even be fundamental - it could emerge from something deeper, like how temperature emerges from molecular motion. In space, clocks on GPS satellites run faster than on Earth due to weaker gravity. Your perception of time accelerates as you age because each year becomes a smaller percentage of your life. And yes, procrastinators, there is a mathematical formula for your struggle: Motivation = (Expectancy × Value) ÷ (Impulsiveness × Delay).",

        explanation: "Love is basically a chemical cocktail party in your brain. Dopamine (the hype friend), oxytocin (the cuddly one), and serotonin (the chiller) all show up. The 'butterflies' feeling? That's literally stress hormones. Long-term love switches from dopamine to oxytocin - from 'I can't stop thinking about you' to 'I can't stop stealing your hoodies'. Romance is biology dressed up as magic.",
        deepDive: "fMRI scans show love activates the same brain regions as addiction. The initial 'falling in love' phase lasts 18 months to 3 years (coincidence? I think not). Heartbreak literally causes physical pain - your brain processes it like a wound. Arranged marriages have similar success rates to love marriages because attachment grows with time. And cats? They definitely don't love you... or do they? (They do, but on their terms.)",

        image: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1533750516457-a7f992034fec?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=600&q=80",
        explanation: "Procrastination isn't laziness - it's your brain choosing instant dopamine over future rewards. You're not bad at time management, you're bad at emotional regulation. The task feels uncomfortable, so you scroll TikTok instead. Your future self is not a different person - they're you, but more tired and regretful. Break tasks into micro-steps: 'open laptop' is easier than 'write essay'.",
        deepDive: "Research shows procrastinators have larger amygdalas (fear center) and weaker prefrontal cortex connections (planning center). We delay tasks that trigger negative emotions - boredom, anxiety, insecurity. The '5-minute rule' works because starting is
